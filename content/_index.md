# About me

\
I am a rising senior at Rutgers University Honors College studying mathematics and computer science. I'm a research assistant at the [Mathematical Optimization Research Group](https://sites.rutgers.edu/farzad-yousefian/), advised by Dr. Farzad Yousefian, working on distributed optimization frameworks for decentralized machine learning.

I'm excited to continue my research in optimization and machine learning, and I am also interested in learning more about compilers, formal verification, and parellelization.

I have previously interned as a software engineer at Amazon, building fraud detection tools for retail, and as a research intern at Avellino Lab, developing robust encryption systems for oncology applications.
