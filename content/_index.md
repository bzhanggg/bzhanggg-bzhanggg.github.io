# About me

\
I am a rising senior at Rutgers University Honors College studying mathematics and computer science. I'm a research assistant at the Mathematical Optimization Research Group, advised by Dr. Farzad Yousefian, studying distributed optimization frameworks for decentralized machine learning.

I'm excited to continue my research in optimization and machine learning, and I am also interested in learning more about compilers, formal verification, and parellelization.

I have previously interned as a software engineer at Amazon, building fraud detection tools for retail, and as a research intern at Avellino Lab, developing robust encryption systems for oncology applications.
