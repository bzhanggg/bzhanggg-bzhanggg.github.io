# About me

\
I am a rising senior at Rutgers University Honors College studying mathematics and computer science. I'm a research assistant at the [Mathematical Optimization Research Group](https://sites.rutgers.edu/farzad-yousefian/), advised by Dr. Farzad Yousefian, working on distributed optimization frameworks for decentralized machine learning.

I'm excited to continue my research in optimization and machine learning, and I am also interested in learning more about compilers, formal verification, and parallelization.

I have previously interned as a software engineer at Amazon, building fraud detection tools for retail, and as a research intern at Avellino Lab, developing robust encryption systems for oncology applications.

Here is my [CV](/bzhang_cv.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). You can reach me at `brian.l.zhang@rutgers.edu`

## Activities

- I am a member of the Rutgers Mathematics Directed Reading Program. Previous topics include elliptic curve cryptography and measure theory.
- I was a backend developer and engineering lead for [Hack4Impact](https://hack4impact.org/) Rutgers.
- I was a teaching assistant for MATH151: Calculus 1 for Engineers (Rutgers University. Fall 2022, Fall 2023).

## Misc

- I am a huge fan of classical music! I was a violinist for the Rutgers Sinfonia in the 2021-2022 orchestra season. I've compiled my favorite works in a [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/12aSUDyCQ0FTuh68nw4XcD?si=773cbf61687d4d4c) playlist. You can check out my other musical interests there too.
- I am the treasurer for Rutgers Olympic Weightlifting, the largest collegiate weightlifting club officially affiliated with USA weightlifting in the Northeast.
