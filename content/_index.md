# About me

\
I am a student at Rutgers University studying mathematics and computer science. I'm a research assistant at the [Mathematical Optimization Research Group](https://sites.rutgers.edu/farzad-yousefian/), advised by Dr. Farzad Yousefian, working on distributed optimization frameworks for decentralized machine learning.

I'm excited to continue my research in optimization and machine learning. I'm also interested in learning more about compilers, formal verification, and parallelization.

Here is my [CV](/bzhang_cv.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). You can reach me at `brian.l.zhang@rutgers.edu`
